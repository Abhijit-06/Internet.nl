# Internet.nl

Internet.nl is an initiative of the Dutch Internet Standards Platform that
helps you to check whether your website, email and internet connection use
modern and reliable Internet Standards. And if they donâ€™t, what can you do
about it?


## Background

With the test tool Internet.nl users can easily check whether their internet is
'up to date' i.e. if their website, email and internet connection use modern
internet standards. The tool provides detailed background information on the
test results with (pointers to) how-to's and manuals.

The test tool Internet.nl is an initiative of the Dutch Internet Standards
Platform which is a collaboration of partners from the internet community and
the Dutch government. The platform's mission is to jointly promote the use of
modern internet standards keeping the internet reliable and accessible for
everybody. [ECP](https://ecp.nl/) provides for the administrative home of the
platform. [NLnet Labs](https://nlnetlabs.nl/) is responsible for the technical
realisation and implementation of the test tool.

## This is all fine but where is the code?

We are in the final stages of migrating our code source to this repository.
Hold tight and check back soon...

Thanks for the interest!
